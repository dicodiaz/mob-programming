# Mob Programming

This is a consolidation of every DSA challenge that was solved as a part of Microverse's morning session. Learning objectives:
- Present your process of thinking through a coding problem to a group of people in a live meeting.
- Practice writing code to solve a problem aloud in front of a group.
- Practice pseudocoding coding challenges.
- Demonstrate the ability to check assumptions when starting to code, bring up test cases, walkthrough possible pseudocode solutions before diving into writing code.
